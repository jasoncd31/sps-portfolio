        A little bit about me!git

      <p>Now for the important stuff</p>
      <p>Projects I've worked on:</p>
      <p>AidMap: A interactive map created for the IvyHacks Hackathon 2020. Based in React, AidMap was a web application so people could
          find different places if they needed a certain type of help. For example, if someone needed Wifi for online schooling, they could
          choose Wifi hotspots and then search for all avaliable hotspots around them. My group and I tracked Wifi hotspots and foodbanks. I was specifically a BackEnd developer incharge of integrating
          MapBox which also meant integrating the data.
